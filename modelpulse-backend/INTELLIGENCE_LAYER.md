# ModelPulse Intelligence Layer & Predictive Insights

This document provides an overview of the intelligence layer and predictive insights features added to ModelPulse in Phase 6.

## Overview

The intelligence layer adds proactive capabilities to ModelPulse, enabling it to:

1. **Predict potential issues** before they occur
2. **Generate actionable recommendations** based on observed trends
3. **Provide natural language interaction** with the system through a chatbot assistant

## Components

### 1. Predictive Alerts

The predictive alerts system uses machine learning to forecast potential model issues before thresholds are breached.

#### Implementation Details

- **File**: `predictive.py`
- **Models**: Time series forecasting models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /predictive/drift/{model_name}`: Predicts future drift metrics
  - `GET /predictive/performance/{model_name}/{metric_type}`: Predicts future performance metrics (latency, confidence)
  - `GET /predictive/alerts`: Provides comprehensive predictive alerts for all models

#### How It Works

1. Historical data is collected from the database
2. Time-based features are extracted
3. ML models are trained on this data
4. Future values are predicted with confidence intervals
5. Predictions are compared against thresholds to identify potential breaches

### 2. Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine analyzes model performance and drift data to generate actionable suggestions.

#### Implementation Details

- **File**: `recommendations.py`
- **Database Model**: `Recommendation` in `models.py`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /recommendations`: Retrieves existing recommendations
  - `POST /recommendations/generate`: Generates new recommendations
  - `PUT /recommendations/{recommendation_id}`: Updates recommendation status

#### Types of Recommendations

- **Retraining recommendations**: When persistent drift is detected
- **Monitoring recommendations**: For models showing warning signs
- **Investigation recommendations**: For sudden changes in performance
- **Optimization recommendations**: For models with high latency
- **Rollback recommendations**: For models with significant degradation

### 3. Conversational Assistant

The conversational assistant provides natural language interaction with ModelPulse.

#### Implementation Details

- **File**: `assistant.py`
- **Integration**: OpenAI GPT API
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /chat`: Processes natural language queries and returns responses

#### Features

- **Context-aware responses**: The assistant has access to model performance data, drift metrics, alerts, and recommendations
- **Natural language understanding**: Users can ask questions in plain English
- **Actionable insights**: The assistant can suggest actions based on the current state of models

## Usage Examples

### Predictive Alerts

```python
# Get drift predictions for a model
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/predictive/drift/my_model",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
)
predictions = response.json()

# Check if there's a predicted breach
if predictions["predicted_breach_time"]:
    print(f"Potential drift detected at: {predictions['predicted_breach_time']}")
```

### Recommendations

```python
# Generate recommendations for an organization
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/recommendations/generate?organization_id=1",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
)
recommendations = response.json()

# Display high priority recommendations
for rec in recommendations:
    if rec["priority"] == "high":
        print(f"High priority: {rec['description']} - {rec['reason']}")
```

### Conversational Assistant

```python
# Chat with the assistant
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/chat",
    json={
        "message": "What's the average latency for Model X this week?",
        "organization_id": 1
    },
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
)
print(response.json()["message"])
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend should be updated to include:

1. **Predictive visualizations**: Charts showing forecasted metrics with confidence intervals
2. **Recommendation cards**: UI components displaying actionable recommendations
3. **Chat widget**: Interface for interacting with the assistant

## Dependencies

The intelligence layer requires the following additional dependencies:

- `xgboost`: For gradient boosting models
- `openai`: For GPT integration
- `langchain`: For LLM context management
- `statsmodels`: For time series analysis

These have been added to the `requirements.txt` file.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the intelligence layer:

1. **More sophisticated forecasting models**: Implement ARIMA, Prophet, or deep learning models
2. **Anomaly detection**: Add capabilities to detect unusual patterns not captured by thresholds
3. **Automated actions**: Enable the system to take corrective actions automatically
4. **Feedback loop**: Incorporate user feedback to improve recommendations and predictions
5. **Multi-model analysis**: Analyze relationships between different models in the same pipeline
